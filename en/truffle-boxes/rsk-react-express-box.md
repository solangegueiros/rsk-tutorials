# Rsk react-express box

How to install and use a Truffle box that comes with React and Express, and work with the RSK network.

In this tutorial, I will show you step-by-step how to use the Truffle box 
[rsk-react-express-box](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-react-express-box), 
which comes with everything you need to start using [express JS](https://expressjs.com/) 
to provide API endpoints to smart contracts and a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) 
to interact with them on [RSK Blockchain](/rsk/).
It includes network configurations for Mainnet, Testnet and the SimpleStorage contract as an example to deploy.

> This tutorial is helpful to review the steps with more explanatory details and images.

# Setup prerequisites

Check out this tutorial to be shure that you have all [prerequisites](/tutorials/truffle-boxes/truffle-boxes-prerequisites/) configured.

# Install RSK Truffle Box

The truffle unbox command sets up a project based on a known template. 
In this tutorial, we will be using the “RSK react-express” Truffle box, 
which provides API endpoints to smart contracts and app to interact with them, 
including RSK network configurations and the SimpleStorage contract as an example to deploy. 

## Create a new folder 
For example, create the folder `rsk-react-express`.
Navigate to the folder in the terminal.

```shell
mkdir rsk-react-express
```

```shell
cd rsk-react-express
```

This is the result using Windows OS:

```windows-command-prompt
C:\>cd C:\RSK

C:\RSK>mkdir rsk-react-express

C:\RSK>cd rsk-react-express

C:\RSK\rsk-react-express>
```

## Run the unbox command

The truffle unbox command will install all necessary dependencies in the project, so it can take some time.

```shell
truffle unbox rsksmart/rsk-react-express-box
```

The `truffle unbox output` should be similar to:

```windows-command-prompt
C:\RSK\rsk-react-express>truffle unbox rsksmart/rsk-react-express-box

Starting unbox...
=================

√ Preparing to download box
√ Downloading
√ cleaning up temporary files
√ Setting up box

Unbox successful, sweet!

Commands:

  Compile contracts:     truffle compile
  Migrate contracts:     truffle migrate
  Test contracts:        truffle test
  Run dev server:        cd app && npm run dev
  Run production server: cd app && npm start
  Build for production:  cd app && npm run build

C:\RSK\rsk-react-express>
```

A `client-server` application is generated in the `app` directory.

## SimpleStorage.sol

Take a look at the smart contract `SimpleStorage.sol`. You can check it out in folder `contracts`.

```javascript
pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.7.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData;

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

This smart contract has:

* A variable `storedData` to store a number
* A function `get()` to return the number stored at variable `storedData`
* A function `set()` to change the number stored at variable `storedData`

# Truffle development console

Truffle has an interactive console that also spawns a development blockchain. 
This is very useful for compiling, deploying and testing locally.

Run the development console by typing the following command below into the terminal:

```shell
truffle develop
```

This command is successful if you see a list of 10 accounts and their associated private keys, 
a mnemonic and the command prompt is now `truffle(develop)>`

```windows-command-prompt
C:\RSK\rsk-next>truffle develop
Truffle Develop started at http://127.0.0.1:8545/

Mnemonic: virtual valve razor retreat either turn possible student grief engage attract fiber

⚠️  Important ⚠️  : This mnemonic was created for you by Truffle. It is not secure.
Ensure you do not use it on production blockchains, or else you risk losing funds.

truffle(develop)>  
```

> Inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`.

# Compile a smart contract

In the Truffle console, run this command:

```javascript
compile
```

The `compile output` should be similar to:

```windows-command-prompt
truffle(develop)> compile

Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Compiling .\contracts\Migrations.sol
> Compiling .\contracts\SimpleStorage.sol
> Artifacts written to C:\RSK\rsk-react-express\app\src\contracts
> Compiled successfully using:
   - solc: 0.5.16+commit.9c3226ce.Emscripten.clang

truffle(develop)>
```

## About contracts_build_directory in Truffle config

Did you notice above that the `artifacts` was written in a different locale?

In `truffle-config.js` file, located in the project folder, we change the localization where files for contracts artifacts are saved, like abi and deployed addresses. 

Take a look at the changes:
- Line 1: library `path` was added.
- Line 37: we add a new parameter `contracts_build_directory` that defines the locale for the contracts artifacts.

It is located in a different folder: `app/src/contracts`.

# Deploy a smart contract

To deploy a smart contract using Truffle, we need a new migrations file where Truffle will find it. 
This file contains instructions to deploy the smart contract. 

The `migrations` folder has JavaScript files that help you deploy contracts to the network. 
These files are responsible for staging your deployment tasks, and they're written under the assumption that your deployment needs will change over time. 
A history of previously run migrations is recorded on-chain through a special Migrations contract. 
(source: [truffle: running-migrations](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations))

Take a look in the file `2_deploy_contracts.js` located in the migrations folder. 

## Migrate

In the Truffle console, run this command:

```javascript
migrate
```

The `migrate output` should be similar to:

```windows-command-prompt

# Test a smart contract

Truffle has an automated testing framework to facilitate the testing of contracts.
All test files should be located in the `test` directory.
To learn more, go to the Truffle documentation, in the section [testing your contracts](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/testing-your-contracts).

This Truffle box also comes with the file `TestSimpleStorage.js` for testing the smart contract. 
You can check it out in the `test` folder.

Run this command in the development console:

```javascript
test
```

This `test output` should be similar to:

![truffle test](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-04.png)

Note the command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the development console.

```javascript
// inside the development console.
test

// outside the development console.
truffle test
```

# Interact with a smart contract in development console

> Make sure you deploy the smart contract before executing this part.

The next commands will run inside the development console.

## Connect with our published contract

```javascript
const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorage.deployed()
```

Now simpleStorage variable contains an instance of the previously deployed contract.

```windows-command-prompt
truffle(develop)> const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorage.deployed()
undefined
truffle(develop)>  
```

Remember that the published contract information is stored in the `app/src/contracts` folder. 
You will find a JSON file with the same name of our smart contract.

The section `networks` has the networks in which the smart contract was published, including its address and hash of the transaction.

![simpleStorage.json networks](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-05.png)

The `ABI - Application Binary Interface` is also very important because to connect with one smart contract, we must know the ABI and the address of the smart contract.

![simpleStorage.json abi](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-06.png)

## Get value

Get the value stored in the contract.

```javascript
simpleStorage.get().then(bn => bn.toNumber())
```

We do not have any value stored, because we do not define anything at the moment when we deployed.

```windows-command-prompt
truffle(develop)> simpleStorage.get().then(bn => bn.toNumber())
0
truffle(develop)>  
```

## Set value

Store some value in the contract.

```javascript
simpleStorage.set(2020)
```

![simpleStorage set](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-07.png)

Have a look at the response. The transaction receipt, generated by the blockchain nodes, is the response for the transaction request.

## Get value (again)

Verify if the value stored in the smart contract was changed.

```javascript
simpleStorage.get().then(bn => bn.toNumber())
```

The value now should be `2020`!

```windows-command-prompt
truffle(develop)> simpleStorage.get().then(bn => bn.toNumber())
2020
truffle(develop)> 
```

# Client-server application

This Truffle box is a client-server: 
- Server uses `express JS` to interact with the smart contract.
- Client uses `react` app.

## Running the application in development mode

In another terminal (i.e. not in the truffle develop prompt), go to the `app` directory to run the application in development mode.

> Do not close the other terminal, which is running the Truffle development console, because it is our Blockchain simulator.
> 
> If you close it and then open it again, you need to deploy / migrate the smart contract again too!

```shell
cd app
npm run dev
```

The `npm run dev output` should be similar to:

![npm run dev](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-08.png)

This command executes both server and client applications and you can access it in your browser:

- Server: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- Client: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

![frontend - server and client](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-09.png)

> Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated!

## Running the production server

You can choose to run only the production server. In another terminal (i.e. not in the truffle develop prompt), go to the `app` directory and run the app in production mode.

```shell
cd app
npm start
```

It can take some time. The `npm start output` should be similar to:

![npm start](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-10.png)

> If you have `yarn` installed, you can use `yarn start`.

Then go to your browser at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

![localhost port 8080](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-11.png)

> When you are running only the production server, for any change you need to stop and run the server again for the updates to take effect!

## Building the application for production

To build the application for production, use the build script in the `app` folder. 
A production build will be in the `app/dist` folder.

```javascript
npm run build
```

The `npm run build output` should be similar to:

![npm run build](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-12.png)

The result will be in the `app/dist` folder. Take a look:

![dist folder](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-13.png)

# Using RSK networks

This Truffle box is already configured to connect to both RSK networks: testnet and mainnet. We need only to update few items:

- RSK network gas price
- Your wallet mnemonic
- Choose the network in the app

## Setup the gas price

**Gas** is the internal pricing for running a transaction or contract. 
When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send RBTC, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation. 
That payment is calculated as gas. 
In RSK, this is paid in **RBTC**.
The **minimumGasPrice** is written in the block header by miners and establishes the minimum gas price that a transaction should have in order to be included in that block.

To update the **minimumGasPrice**, go to your project folder and run this query using cURL:

**Testnet**

```shell
curl https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co/ \
    -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false],"id":1}' \
    > .minimum-gas-price-testnet.json
```

**Mainnet**

```shell
curl https://public-node.rsk.co/ \
    -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false],"id":1}' \
    > .minimum-gas-price-mainnet.json
```

This query saved the details of latest block to 
file .minimum-gas-price-testnet.json 
or .minimum-gas-price-mainnet.json, respectively.

This is the result of Testnet query in the terminal in Windows OS:

![minimum gas price testnet](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-14.png)

In the `truffle-config.js`, we are reading the parameter `minimumGasPrice` in each json file.

For more information about the **Gas** and **minimumGasPrice** please go to [gas page](/rsk/rbtc/gas/ "Gas - RSK Developers Portal").

## Create a wallet mnemonic

If you don't have a wallet mnemonic, check it out in in the tutorial [prerequisites](/tutorials/truffle-boxes/truffle-boxes-prerequisites/).

## Update mnemonic in Truffle config

In `truffle-config.js`, locate this line: 

```javascript
const mnemonic = 'A_MNEMONIC';
```

![A_MNEMONIC](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-15.png)

Substitute `A_MNEMONIC` with the mnemonic of your wallet.

Im my example, it will be:

```javascript
const mnemonic = 'virtual valve razor retreat either turn possible student grief engage attract fiber';
```

## HD wallet provider

To connect to the RSK network, we are going to use a provider that allows us to connect to any network by unlocking an account locally. 
We are using `@truffle/hdwallet-provider`. It was installed with the box.

Please be aware that we are using `HDWalletProvider` with RSK Networks derivations path:
- RSK Mainnet dpath: `m/44’/137’/0’/0`
- RSK Testnet dpath: `m/44’/37310’/0’/0`

For more information, check the [account based RSK addresses](/rsk/architecture/account-based/ "Account based RSK addresses - RSK developers portal").

## Using Truffle Console to connect to the RSK network

 Run the development console for any RSK network.

**Testnet**

```shell
truffle console --network testnet
```

 **Mainnet**

```shell
truffle console --network mainnet
```

This action instructs Truffle to connect to an RSK public node and grants it permission to control the accounts created with your mnemonic through the `HD wallet provider`.

I will connect to the Testnet network:

```windows-command-prompt
C:\RSK\rsk-react-express>truffle console --network testnet
truffle(testnet)>  
```

## Get your addresses / accounts

We will use a special instruction in Truffle console to get the first 10 addresses in our hierarchical deterministic wallet for the RSK Testnet network, that are generated from our mnemonic.

Inside the Truffle console, run this command to save the addresses at variable `accounts`:

```javascript
const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
```

```windows-command-prompt
truffle(testnet)>  const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
undefined
truffle(testnet)>
```

Don't worry about the `undefined` return, it is ok. 
See the addresses after it by entering the command below:

```javascript
accounts
```

```windows-command-prompt
truffle(testnet)> accounts
[ '0x4417CdC73f53573999F3A0397eE9df560a2f0507',
  '0x390BeD29A3F28772eDdcB02750c5A58FE7793647',
  '0x723dB256f61be581a6cA404d71D1d1951dD83F5e',
  '0x546A13cFe418BCd8E149C78C234a953Ba79FC427',
  '0xa88b72640758861f8ED4106241d743B948f7D55a',
  '0xC48141Ca379f27eEABcEaBc26e5E2c2f6130b2A1',
  '0xE7254aa2147549dbDA01559B449A61f993bA9b16',
  '0xa52DB3045a6A880149d87014FbCAeb33a2FDbE51',
  '0x7f3255db0514e0b78175e3f72DEC006B713AA166',
  '0x4eD69220224f9aC13e867961027C4599fFa74409' ]
truffle(testnet)>
```

To view each account:

```javascript
accounts[0]
accounts[1]
```

Take a look in the result:

![accounts](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-16.png)

In my example, the `account[0]` is `0x4417CdC73f53573999F3A0397eE9df560a2f0507`.

## Check balance

To check the balance of `account[0]`, for example, run this command in Truffle console:

```javascript
(await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0])).toString()
```

```windows-command-prompt
truffle(testnet)> (await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0])).toString()
'0'
truffle(testnet)>  
```

The balance is 0 and we need some tRBTC to pay gas fees,
which will be used to publish smart contracts and interact with them.
We shall obtain some tRBTC in the next step.

## Exit Truffle console

In the Truffle console, enter this command to exit the terminal:

```shell
.exit
```

```windows-command-prompt
truffle(testnet)> .exit

C:\RSK\rsk-starter>
```

## Get RBTC

The Smart Bitcoin (RBTC) is the token used to pay for the execution of transactions in RSK.

**Mainnet**

For the RSK Mainnet, get RBTC from [an exchange](https://www.rsk.co/#exchanges-rsk).

**Testnet**

For the RSK Testnet, get tRBTC from [our faucet](https://faucet.testnet.rsk.co/).

![faucet.testnet.rsk.co](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-17.png)

Enter your wallet address and pass the CAPTCHA.

Wait a few seconds…

![wait faucet](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-18.png)

This is an example of a transaction hash received from faucet:

[`0x0661f313cb387b6f09549a7f81ca7c0e7cc476cfe6069a9c755b1ceb8b531874`](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/tx/0x0661f313cb387b6f09549a7f81ca7c0e7cc476cfe6069a9c755b1ceb8b531874)

![faucet Received some R-BTCs](../../images/rsk-react-express-box/image-19.png)

# Deploy the smart contract on RSK network

Migrate the smart contracts. 
We will do it by running the below commands directly in the terminal, 
without using the truffle console now to show to you this alternative. 
Run the migrate command for the RSK network of your choice.

**Testnet**

```shell
truffle migrate --network testnet
```

**Mainnet**

```shell
truffle migrate --network mainnet
```

I will do it on RSK testnet.

```windows-command-prompt

Congratulations!

`Simple storage` is now published on the RSK network.

> Make sure you have enough RBTC to deploy it.

# Client-server application on RSK network

The express JS server uses the [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) library to interact with the blockchain - writing code that reads and writes data from the blockchain with smart contracts.

To connect the client-server application to an RSK network, we just have to update a single line in the express JS component.

## Update connection

Open the file `app/src/server/index.js`

Choose which network you would like to connect the server to RSK Network and update line 11:

**Testnet**
```js
const provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co");
```

**Mainnet**
```js
const provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("https://public-node.rsk.co");
```

## Running the app

In a terminal, go to the `app` directory and run the app.

For example, this command will run the production server:

```shell
cd app
npm start
```

Then go to your browser at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

> Note that when you are connected to an RSK network, you do not need to leave open the Truffle console, because the app is connected via a public node, directly to the network.

# Final considerations

In this tutorial you learned how to use the Truffle box [rsk-react-express-box](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-react-express-box), 
which comes with everything you need to start using Truffle on RSK networks. 

Check out [RSK Blockchain](/rsk/) for more details about us.

I hope this tutorial has been helpful and I'd appreciate your feedback.
